Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is useful in allowing all teammates to contribute towards a 
project, while having safety features to ensure that nothing gets 
overwritten without approval and feedback from other teammates. This is 
crucial towards preventing further complications as the project complexity 
builds.
